# Mark Antonov's First CS193 Homework

### My favorite things about CS193::
- There are no exams :)
- Homework is 70% of the grade
- CS 182 sneak peak (syllabus said so) !!!!!!?1??!!?!?!?
- Terminal stuff is cool
- I will finally unleash LaTeX in this class
- TA's are chill
- No (-) grades, so less grade worries
